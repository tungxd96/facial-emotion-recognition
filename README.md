## Introduction

Facial Emotion Recognition is a crucial component in human-computer interaction and can find applications in areas like virtual reality, customer feedback analysis, and more. This project provides an open-source solution for implementing facial emotion recognition using state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

## Features

- Emotion detection in real-time or from images
- Support for 8 emotions (e.g., anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, surprise)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x (e.g., 3.9.6)
- Additional dependencies: numpy, tensorflow, sklearn, dlib, matplotlib, cv2

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/tungxd96/facial-emotion-recognition.git
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. Run:

    ```zsh
    python3 main.py
    ```
